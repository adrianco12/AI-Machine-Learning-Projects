# Linear Regression: How It Works

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship, meaning the change in the dependent variable is proportional to the change in the independent variables.

## Key Concepts

- **Dependent Variable (Y):** The outcome or target variable you want to predict.
- **Independent Variable(s) (X):** The predictor(s) or feature(s) used to predict Y.
- **Linear Model:** The relationship is modeled as a straight line (or hyperplane in multiple dimensions):
  
  \[
  Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \dots + \beta_n X_n + \epsilon
  \]
  
  where:
  - \(\beta_0\) is the intercept (value of Y when all Xs are zero),
  - \(\beta_i\) are coefficients (weights) for each independent variable,
  - \(\epsilon\) is the error term (difference between observed and predicted values).

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection:** Gather data points with known values of independent and dependent variables.

2. **Model Fitting:** Use a method like **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** to find the coefficients \(\beta\) that minimize the sum of squared differences between observed values and predicted values:
   
   \[
   \min_{\beta} \sum_{i=1}^m (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
   \]
   
   where \(y_i\) are actual values and \(\hat{y}_i\) are predicted values.

3. **Prediction:** Once coefficients are estimated, predict new values by plugging independent variables into the linear equation.

4. **Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using metrics such as:
   - **R-squared:** Proportion of variance in dependent variable explained by the model.
   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Average squared difference between observed and predicted values.

## Applications

Linear regression is widely used in economics, biology, engineering, and many other fields for prediction, trend analysis, and understanding relationships between variables.
