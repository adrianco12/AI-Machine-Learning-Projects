# AI & Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to the repository for my AI and Machine Learning projects. This repository contains all the work completed during a hands-on introduction to machine learning and artificial intelligence using Python, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and Keras.

## Course Overview

This course provides an in-depth, hands-on experience with the full machine learning workflow, including:
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
- **Classical Machine Learning Algorithms** (e.g., Linear Regression, SVM, Decision Trees)
- **Deep Neural Networks** (e.g., Feedforward Neural Networks, CNNs, RNNs)
- **Advanced Models** (e.g., GANs, Reinforcement Learning)

By working with these models, students learn the essential techniques to build and optimize AI solutions, from raw data to intelligent decision-making systems.
