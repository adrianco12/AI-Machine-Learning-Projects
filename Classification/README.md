# Classification Example Project – MNIST Dataset

## Overview
This project demonstrates a **supervised learning task: classification** using the MNIST dataset of handwritten digit images. We explore **binary, multiclass, and multioutput classification**, along with evaluation techniques.

## Dataset Structure
The MNIST dataset has a structure similar to many other datasets:

- **DESCR**: Description of the dataset  
- **Data**: Array with one row per instance and one column per feature  
- **Target**: Array with corresponding labels  

Before exploring the data, we **set aside a test set** to ensure unbiased evaluation.

## Binary Classification
We start with a **binary classifier** to distinguish between two classes: `5` and `not-5`. The classifier predicts whether a given image belongs to the target class and its performance is evaluated using:

### Cross-Validation
Cross-validation helps check how well a model performs on **unseen data**:

1. Split the data into **k folds**.  
2. Train on **k-1 folds**, test on the remaining fold.  
3. Repeat **k times** with different folds.  
4. Average the results for a more reliable performance score.

Example: **5-fold cross-validation** trains on 4 folds and tests on 1, repeating 5 times. This reduces overfitting and gives a better estimate of real-world performance.

## Confusion Matrix
A **confusion matrix** shows predicted vs actual outcomes:

|                  | Predicted Positive | Predicted Negative |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Actual Positive** | True Positive (TP) | False Negative (FN) |
| **Actual Negative** | False Positive (FP) | True Negative (TN) |

- **TP**: Correctly labeled as target digit  
- **TN**: Correctly labeled as NOT the target digit  
- **FP**: Wrongly predicted as target digit  
- **FN**: Target digit predicted as something else  

This allows computation of **precision** and **recall**:

- **Precision**: Of all predicted positives, how many are correct?  
- **Recall**: Of all actual positives, how many were caught?  

**Trade-off**:  
- Strict model → High precision, low recall  
- Loose model → High recall, low precision  

---

## ROC Curve
The **ROC curve** visualizes classifier performance across thresholds:

- **X-axis**: False Positive Rate (FPR)  
- **Y-axis**: True Positive Rate (TPR / recall)  

- Perfect model → Top-left corner  
- Random guess → Diagonal line  

The closer the curve is to the top-left, the better the classifier.

---

## Multiclass Classification
Binary classifiers distinguish between two classes. Multiclass classifiers handle **more than two classes**:

### Strategies
- **One-vs-Rest (OvR)**: Train one classifier per class (class vs all others). Pick the class with the highest confidence.  
- **One-vs-One (OvO)**: Train a classifier for every pair of classes. Each classifier votes; the class with most votes is chosen.

---

## Error Analysis
- Analyze **confusion matrix** visually using Matplotlib.  
- Focus on **error rates** by normalizing values per class to compare instead of absolute errors.  

---

## Multi-Label & Multi-Output Classification
- **Multiclass Classification**: Predict one label out of multiple classes (e.g., MNIST digits 0–9).  
- **Multioutput Classification**: Predict multiple labels at once (e.g., a face image classified by gender, age group, and expression). Each output is treated separately but predicted together.

This project demonstrates the core principles of classification, evaluation, and error analysis for various types of supervised learning tasks.
