Machine Learning is a way of programming computers so that they can learn or recognize patterns from data, rather than programming exact instructions. In traditional programming, a computer follows an order. This means that for many different aspects of a problem, instructions for the computer must be hard-coded. In machine learning, however, the computer can adapt and tackle new aspects of a problem, without needing predefined directions.  

Supervised machine learning is when you feed a computer data along with the correct answers for them. For example, you can give the computer pictures of different animals, and label them with the names of each animal. In this case, the computer learns which animals are which, and when presented with a new photo of an animal, the computer would be able to identify it.  

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the computer is given data without any labels or correct answers. Instead of being told what the output should be, the system looks for patterns, structures, or groupings within the data on its own. Common tasks include clustering (grouping similar items together) and dimensionality reduction (simplifying data while keeping important information). For example, an unsupervised algorithm could group customers based on their shopping habits without knowing their age or preferences in advance.

One of the simplest applications of machine learning is the spam filter. In the book, the author describes how the spam filter works: it is trained with a multitude of emails and are labeled as either spam or ham. The filter then looks at patterns in those emails, recognizing patterns for each category. For example, the filter might recognize a phrase such as “free money” in multiple emails labeled as spam and be able to determine if a new email is spam based on that information. 

In my code for this chapter, I created a histogram utilizing the iris class and the matplotlib class. This code prints the names of the features and species used in the histogram and displays a histogram of petal length and width for the specific species. This connects to the chapter because it represents labeled data that can be used to predict the specific species. It helps us visualize the relationship between features and labels, which is what supervised learning relies on.
