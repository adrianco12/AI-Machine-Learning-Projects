# End-to-End Machine Learning Project üöÄ

This project is a structured walkthrough of building a complete **end-to-end machine learning pipeline**. It begins with **data exploration and visualization** to uncover insights and progresses through data preparation, model training, fine-tuning, and evaluation. The goal is to provide a hands-on foundation for applying ML techniques to real-world datasets.
